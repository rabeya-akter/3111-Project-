# Automated Stock Trading Using Approximate Q Learning (Linear Approximation)

This project was done as the final project of RME 3211 (Intelligent Systems and Robotics Lab). Here we used Approximate (Linear Approximation) Q Learning for automatic stock trading of three stocks: 

* [Grameenphone Ltd (GRAE)](https://www.investing.com/equities/grameenphone-ltd)
* [Square Pharmaceuticals Ltd (SQPH)](https://www.investing.com/equities/square-pharmaceuticals-ltd)
* [ACI Formulations Ltd (ACIF)](https://www.investing.com/equities/aci-formulations-ltd) 


We tested the work both including the COVID 19 timeline and excluding the COVID 19 timeline in Bangladesh. We found an Return on Investment value of 13.29% on including COVID 19 timeline and -37.46% on excluding COVID 19 timeline while testing. Our best result's Price-Buy-Sell graph is shown on the three stocks:
